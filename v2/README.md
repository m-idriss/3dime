# 3dime v2 - Angular Application

This directory contains the next-generation Angular application for the 3dime personal social hub.

## Overview

**3dime v2** is a modern Angular application that will eventually replace the current static website. It's being developed in parallel to ensure a smooth transition and maintain all existing functionality while adding modern framework benefits.

## Architecture

- **Framework**: Angular v20+ with standalone APIs
- **Rendering**: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) with Angular Universal
- **Styling**: SCSS with custom design tokens
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier + Husky pre-commit hooks
- **Design**: Glass-morphism dark theme with no rounded corners
- **Deployment**: `/v2/` path (parallel to existing site at `/`)

â””â”€â”€ eslint.config.js            # ESLint configuration
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Angular CLI 20+

### Installation

```bash
# Navigate to v2 directory
cd v2

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4200/`

## Available Scripts

### Development

```bash
npm start              # Start development server (http://localhost:4200)
npm run watch          # Build and watch for changes
```

### Building

```bash
npm run build          # Production build
npm run build:v2       # Production build with /v2/ base href
```

### Code Quality

```bash
npm run lint           # Run ESLint
npm run lint:fix       # Fix ESLint issues automatically
npm run format         # Format code with Prettier
npm run format:check   # Check if code is formatted
```

### Testing

```bash
npm test               # Run unit tests
```

### SSR (Server-Side Rendering)

```bash
npm run serve:ssr:v2   # Serve SSR build locally
```

## Design System

### Design Tokens

The application uses a comprehensive design token system defined in `src/styles/_design-tokens.scss`:

- **Colors**: Dark theme palette with primary accent color
- **Typography**: Responsive font scale with system fonts
- **Spacing**: 4px-based spacing scale
- **Shadows**: Glass-morphism shadow system
- **Border Radius**: Set to 0 (no rounded corners)
- **Breakpoints**: Mobile-first responsive breakpoints

### SCSS Mixins

Utility mixins in `src/styles/_mixins.scss`:

- **Glass Effects**: `@include mixins.glass-card()`
- **Responsive**: `@include mixins.respond-to(breakpoint)`
- **Typography**: `@include mixins.heading(size)`
- **Layout**: `@include mixins.flex-center()`
- **Buttons**: `@include mixins.button-primary()`

### Usage Example

```scss
.my-component {
  @include mixins.glass-card('lg');
  @include mixins.respond-to(md) {
    @include mixins.heading('2xl');
  }
}
```

## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint with Angular recommended rules
- Prettier for consistent formatting
- Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality

### Component Architecture

- Standalone components (no NgModules)
- Reactive programming with RxJS
- OnPush change detection strategy
- Accessibility-first development

### Naming Conventions

- **Components**: PascalCase (e.g., `HeroComponent`)
- **Files**: kebab-case (e.g., `hero.component.ts`)
- **CSS Classes**: kebab-case with BEM methodology
- **Variables**: camelCase

- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Performance Targets

- Lighthouse Performance: â‰¥ 90
- Lighthouse SEO: â‰¥ 90

- Cumulative Layout Shift: < 0.1

## Contributing

1. Follow the established code style and conventions
2. Write meaningful commit messages
3. Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes
4. Update documentation when making changes to APIs or architecture

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Build errors with SCSS:**
- Ensure all `@use` statements are at the top of files
- Check mixin namespace usage (e.g., `mixins.glass-card()`)

**Development server issues:**
- Clear Angular cache: `rm -rf .angular/cache`
- Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

**SSR issues:**
- Ensure no browser-specific APIs are used in server context
- Use `isPlatformBrowser()` guards when necessary
