# 3dime Angular Migration Roadmap

## Overview

This document outlines the complete roadmap for migrating the current static 3dime website to a modern Angular v17+ application. The migration will preserve all existing functionality while adding modern framework benefits and maintaining the current site at `/` during the transition.

## Architecture Decision

- **Current**: Hybrid static website with optional PHP backend services
- **Target**: Angular v17+ with SSR (Angular Universal), standalone APIs
- **Deployment Strategy**: Parallel deployment (current site at `/`, Angular at `/v2`)
- **Design Preservation**: Maintain existing glass-morphism design and dark theme
- **Content Migration**: Preserve all structured data and SEO optimizations
